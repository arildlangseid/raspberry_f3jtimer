# raspberry_f3jtimer
F3J and F5J Timer based on Raspberry PI and 7-segment LED-display

This project implements a F3J/F5J Timer for large LED-displays using Raspberry PI.

Timing for playing the .ogg files must be changed according to distro and version used on the Raspberry PI.

More to come :-)

Best Regards,
